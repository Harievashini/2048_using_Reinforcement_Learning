# 2048_using_Reinforcement_Learning

Implemented the game 2048 using reinforcement Learning based on Q learning and the design involves the use of neural networks as the function approximation method. 


Run play_game.py in order to launch the game. Network_2048.py contains the implementation of neural network for the game and
logic_2048.py contains logic to compute rewards and generate the next state.
These methods are imported in play_game.py
